# Advent of Code 2024

https://adventofcode.com/2024

After all these years, I bit the bullet and started Advent of Code this year, 2024. Let's see how far I can stick with this!

I'm also taking this opportunity to write something in Rust ðŸ¦€.

## How do I work here?

Nothing fancy. I set up the repo with `cargo init` which gave me the `src` directory.

I put the different days' solution attempts under `src/bin` as `[0-9]+(a|b)/main.rs`, e.g. `src/bin/1a/main.rs`, so that I can run them with:

```sh
cargo run --bin 1a
```

I have a `0` directory as a playground to test minimal Rust code in.
